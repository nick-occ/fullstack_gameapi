What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
To the Game model I added a function to make a move on the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.  With making a move also comes additional steps such as checking if the move results in a win, if so updating the score for each players total score and if no moves remain issuing a draw.  Also the game is designed to work with one or two players.  I added logic so that when only one user was provided when creating the game a random move will be auto generated after the user makes their move.  Extra logic had to run when game was in single vs. two player mode.

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
With the Tic-Tac-Toe grid I decided to make the grid a standard list rather than a multi dimensional array.  It was easier to add values during each move to a single list than using a numpy array within the Google Cloud Platform API.
